        <section class="text-content">

            <span id="case-title">Cyber Attacks on CCSD</span>
            Nevada's Clark County School District (CCSD) is the nation's fifth
            largest district, with <span class="bold">304,276</span> students
            enrolled in the 2022-2023 reporting year. This represents a
            significant portion of Nevada's K-12 student population --
            <span class="bold">approximately 73%!</span>

            <br /><br />Having attended all of my K-12 years at Walter V. Long
            Elementary School, John C. Fremont Middle School, and Las Vegas High
            School, CCSD is <span class="bold">"my district."</span>

            <br /><br />Between the years of 2016-2023, CCSD experienced at
            least
            <span class="bold">six separate data breaches. </span>

            <br /><br />A major incident occurred in
            <span class="bold">October of 2023</span>, leading to the compromise
            of highly sensitive information belonging to the district’s
            teachers, students, and graduates (and their families)! It is
            estimated that more than <span class="bold">300K</span> students had
            their information released, including
            <span class="bold">student pictures</span>,
            <span class="bold">household contact information</span>,
            <span class="bold">medical information</span>, and
            <span class="bold">behavior incident reports</span>.

            <br /><br />With approximately 73% of Nevada's K-12 students being
            served by CCSD, this is a huge portion of the state's overall
            percentage of students affected by a data breach (79.4%). Put
            another way, <span class="bold">4 out of every 5</span> students in
            Nevada have had their data leaked since 2016.

            <br /><br />The leakage of this data through cyberattacks is not
            only <span class="bold">invasive</span>, but it is also
            <span class="bold">frightening</span>. There are broad implications
            that breaches like this can have on
            <span class="bold">personal privacy</span>,
            <span class="bold">safety</span>, and
            <span class="bold">psychological well-being.</span> In addition,
            trust can be lost and the educational environment can suffer.

            <br /><br />It is therefore <span class="bold">essential</span> that
            CCSD works to ensure robust cybersecurity measures to
            <span class="bold">protect</span> the vulnerable population of
            students and to maintain the integrity of its institution.
